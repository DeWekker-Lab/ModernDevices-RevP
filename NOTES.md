# Modern Devices Rev P Notes

a project to build a 3D anemometer using these [Modern Device Rev P senors](https://moderndevice.com/product/wind-sensor-rev-p/) that were formerly used in an engineering capstone project [Wolf_DeWekker_2017.pdf](https://github.com/DeWekker-Lab/ModernDevices-RevP/blob/master/Wolf_DeWekker_2017.pdf)

will be mounted to a [vane mount](https://kestrelmeters.com/products/kestrel-rotating-vane-mount-carry-case-for-5000-series-1) to capture wind speed and direction from four sensors.

* * *

## Tasks
- [ ] Create BOM
- [ ] Measure [zero wind term](https://moderndevice.com/uncategorized/calibrating-rev-p-wind-sensor-new-regression/?preview=true) 


  * * *

## Sensor Requirements:
- 9-12 vdc from input into Arduino.
  - **12 vdc** is optimal.
- The sensor has build in voltage divider. for both the temperature and the wind analog outputs.

* * *

## Parts List:
- [ ] 12 vdc voltage regulator
